# Provisioning Compute Resources

Kubernetes requires a set of machines to host the Kubernetes control plane and the worker nodes where containers are ultimately run. In this lab you will provision the Raspberry Pis required for running a secure Kubernetes cluster. Additional Raspberry Pis can be added to ensure the cluster is highly available.

## Networking

The Kubernetes [networking model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model) assumes a flat network in which containers and nodes can communicate with each other. In cases where this is not desired [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) can limit how groups of containers are allowed to communicate with each other and external network endpoints.

> Setting up network policies is out of scope for this tutorial.

### Private Network

This cluster will be deployed to a local network behind a physical router. Commodity hardware is sufficient for this tutorial. The subnet used by the router should be large to assign a private IP address to each physical node in the Kubernetes cluster. Ideally, a static address is assigned to each node in the router configuration, matching the MAC address of the Raspberry Pi network adapters to an IP.

> The `192.168.1.0/24` IP address range can host up to 254 compute instances.

### Firewall Rules

All traffic within the local network should allow internal communication across all protocols. In order to access the cluster from outside the network, the router firewall must be configured to forward traffic to the cluster.

> Setting up the router firewall is out of scope for this tutorial.

### Load Balancing the Kubernetes API

Traffic to the API server can be load balanced across multiple control plane hosts to achieve high availability.

> Setting up a load balancer for a highly available control plane is out of scope for this tutorial.

### Kubernetes Public IP Address

The IP address allocated by an ISP to your local network would be used as the public facing IP. All traffic to this IP would be routed to the load balancer to then distribute requests across the control plane hosts in a highly available control plane configuration.

> Setting up a public facing IP address for the Kubernetes API is out of scope for this tutorial.

## Compute Instances

The compute instances in this lab will be provisioned using [Ubuntu Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server) 20.04, which has good support for the [containerd container runtime](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). Each compute instance will be provisioned with a fixed private IP address to simplify the Kubernetes bootstrapping process.

### Kubernetes Controllers

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes control plane:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create controller-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type e2-standard-2 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.1${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,controller
done
```

### Kubernetes Workers

Each worker instance requires a pod subnet allocation from the Kubernetes cluster CIDR range. The pod subnet allocation will be used to configure container networking in a later exercise. The `pod-cidr` instance metadata will be used to expose pod subnet allocations to compute instances at runtime.

> The Kubernetes cluster CIDR range is defined by the Controller Manager's `--cluster-cidr` flag. In this tutorial the cluster CIDR range will be set to `10.200.0.0/16`, which supports 254 subnets.

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes worker nodes:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create worker-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type e2-standard-2 \
    --metadata pod-cidr=10.200.${i}.0/24 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.2${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,worker
done
```

### Verification

List the compute instances in your default compute zone:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="tags.items=kubernetes-the-hard-way"
```

> output

```

worker-2      us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.22  XX.XXX.XX.XX   RUNNING
```

## Configuring SSH Access

SSH will be used to configure the controller and worker instances. When connecting to compute instances for the first time SSH keys will be generated for you and stored in the project or instance metadata as described in the [connecting to instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) documentation.

Test SSH access to the `controller-0` compute instances:

```
gcloud compute ssh controller-0
```

If this is your first time connecting to a compute instance SSH keys will be generated for you. Enter a passphrase at the prompt to continue:

```
WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
WARNING: SSH keygen will be executed to generate a key.
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

At this point the generated SSH keys will be uploaded and stored in your project:

```
Your identification has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.
Your public key has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:nz1i8jHmgQuGt+WscqP5SeIaSy5wyIJeL71MuV+QruE $USER@$HOSTNAME
The key's randomart image is:

```

After the SSH keys have been updated you'll be logged into the `controller-0` instance:

```
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1042-gcp x86_64)
...
```

Type `exit` at the prompt to exit the `controller-0` compute instance:

```
$USER@controller-0:~$ exit
```
> output

```
logout
Connection to XX.XX.XX.XXX closed
```
